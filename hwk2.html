//  PROBLEM: Use jQuery to generate a list of links to the course titles inncluded in the page, similar to a table of contents nav
//    - can't hard-code IDs or lists, all done via jQuery based on content... so someone could seamlessly add/remove courses
// get the list of courses in 'content' class divs (who knows, another dept may add their courses)
// 'i' at 1 to iterate for unique IDs
// assign the unique ID with 'i' to the currently selected element (h3)
// assign text content of current element to a variable...
// append the unordered list, I placed in a nav element 'cuz I could, with the list item wrapped in an <a></a>
// add a href atribute with the value of the current course's ID
// iterate up and close the each loop
// also removed unordered list decoration style
